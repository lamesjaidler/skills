All notable changes to the plugins in this marketplace are documented here. Each
plugin is versioned independently via its `plugin.json`; entries below are
grouped by plugin and release.

The format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## product-critique

### [0.0.0] — 2026-06-18

Initial release. **Experimental** — both skills only lightly tested; expect
rough edges and breaking changes.

- `critique-spec` skill: critiques a spec / design doc / PRD before
  implementation planning, returning findings as concrete proposed spec edits.
- `critique-implementation-plan` skill: critiques an implementation plan before
  execution, returning findings as concrete proposed plan edits.

## qualitative-product-research

### [0.1.0] — 2026-06-18

Added to the marketplace. **Experimental.**

- `practicing-user-interviews` skill: roleplays a realistic potential user of
  your app and coaches your interview questions toward specific past behaviour.
- `live-interview-copilot` skill: suggests the single best next question during
  a real, live interview.
- Shared `interview-principles.md` at the plugin root, consumed by both skills
  via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
